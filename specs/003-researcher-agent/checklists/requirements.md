# Specification Quality Checklist: Researcher Agent

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-11-28
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Specification effectively captures the complex AI agent workflow while maintaining business focus
- User stories properly prioritize foundational discovery capabilities before advanced evaluation features
- Success criteria are appropriately scoped for constitutional compliance and human oversight requirements
- Dependencies clearly identify required supporting infrastructure including semantic search and ingestion pipelines
- All sections completed according to template requirements

## Validation Results

**PASS**: All checklist items pass validation. The specification is complete, well-structured, and ready for the next phase.

**Issues Found**: None - specification meets all quality criteria and effectively captures the sophisticated researcher agent requirements while maintaining constitutional compliance.
